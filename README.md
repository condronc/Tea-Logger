### Current Features
- Add a tea by name

- Search a tea by name
- Edit and save an entry by selecting
  - *time edited not done currently*

### Planned Features/Short Goals
- ~~Edit entries~~
- Add more and detailed fields to be entered for a tea
  - Ex: Brand, Tea Type, Personal ratings...
- Flavor dictionary
  - First implementation would be a simple notes section.

### Long term goals
- Vizualize statistics (pie/bar charts) based on logs
  - Ex: A pie chart based off ratings... maybe someone will see they prefer Black Tea over most varieties.
- Track inventory of your current tea collection (when logged the program should subtract one from the database).
- Eventually webfacing or mobile interface?
